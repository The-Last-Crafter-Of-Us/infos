The Last Crafter Of Us is a Minecraft modpack that aims to create multiplayer events in a post-apocalyptic world similar to DayZ or The Last Of Us.

To do this, the modpack will use the modpack [Nohtis Apohcalyps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nohtis-apohcalyps) as a base.
In addition, many features will be developed by us to improve the experience, such as:
1. Shop and bank
2. Spawn mechanics
3. Custom mechanics for some events
4. Mechanics modifying the difficulty of the game in real time
