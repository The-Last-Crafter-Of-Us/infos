# The War That Ended All Wars
The War That Ended All Wars is the Minecraft event that started this project.

This project is similar to the event [The Last Of Us MC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6K2IUhDWI) organized by the influencer Siphano.

## Principle
This event is an ultra-hardcore event, not in the UHC sense, but in the sense that it is really hard.

First of all, the objective of this event is to get a maximum of points to climb in the ranking. To do this, players will have to complete objectives/quests that will earn them points.
But, in addition to having the PvP activated in addition to the PvE, the difficulty will increase every X time. That is, after a certain number of hours of play, the difficulty will increase: fewer hearts, more monsters, etc.
